### Todo App

React-Native app using expo. Notice that the app cannot be run in the web as expo-local-authentication does not support it.

## The following scripts are available at your service:

- `yarn start` - Starts the Metro bundler
- `yarn run android` - Starts the app on iOS simulator
- `yarn run ios` - Starts the app on Android simulator
- `yarn run web` - Starts on the web (without authentication)
- `yarn run test` - Runs all the unit tests
