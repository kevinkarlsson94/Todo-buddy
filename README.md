React-Native app using expo. A webified build can be found here:\

## Prerequisites

- An installed iOS/Android device. Can also be run using Expo app installed on a real device.

## The following scripts are available at your service:

- `yarn start` - Starts the Metro bundler
- `yarn run android` - Starts the app on iOS simulator
- `yarn run ios` - Starts the app on Android simulator
- `yarn run web` - Starts on the web (without authentication)
- `yarn run test` - Runs all the unit tests

### Future improvements ideas

- Be able to save state when closing app, maybe filestream or sync-storage
- Animations
