# Todo App

React-Native app using expo. A webified build can be found here:\
[Todo app](https://todobuddy-kevin.netlify.app/)

Compared to the original prerequisite, I decided that todos can only be edited by pressing the edit button next to the delete button, not by pressing anywhere in the todo item.

## Prerequisites

- An installed iOS/Android device. Can also be run using Expo app installed on a real device.

## The following scripts are available at your service:

- `yarn start` - Starts the Metro bundler
- `yarn run android` - Starts the app on iOS simulator
- `yarn run ios` - Starts the app on Android simulator
- `yarn run web` - Starts on the web (without authentication)
- `yarn run test` - Runs all the unit tests

### Future improvements ideas

- Be able to save state when closing app, maybe filestream or sync-storage
- Animations
